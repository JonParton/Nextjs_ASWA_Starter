Any files stored here will be automagically served up by Next.js to the root of the website.

So, for example, the image stored at `/public/images/undraw_next_js_8g5m.png` can be included any where in the app with the src below:

```jsx
<img src="/images/undraw_next_js_8g5m.png" />
```

**Notice** the lack of `/public` at the front!
